## MTE546 Multi-data Sensor Fusion

Why do we even need to fuse sensor data? If you've ever tried using the same sensor to measure the same thing, the results will vary. Fusing sensors together helps to reduce noise and uncertainty, as you can never be 100% certain. This course goes over the math and algorithms to do this.
