## ECE459 Programming For Performance

This course is all about methods to get your code running quickly AND safely.

Finding a good definition of **concurrency** vs **parallelism** is confusing. Parallelism is all about running many things at once. The main problem is dependencies (whether the output of one task is needed by another task) which limits parallelization. Concurrency is about managing tasks that are executing in different orders. Its main concern is synchronization (mutexes and semaphores) which makes sure your overlapping tasks don't cause bugs that break the system.
